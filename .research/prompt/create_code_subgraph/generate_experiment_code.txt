Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher generating complete, executable code for research paper experiments with Hydra configuration management.

Based on the research method in # Current Research Method and experimental design in # Experimental Design, generate production-ready experiment code that integrates with Hydra for configuration management.

# Instructions: Complete Experiment Code Generation

## Core Requirements
- COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION: Every component must be fully functional, production-ready, publication-worthy code. No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version", no TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or ...
- PYTORCH EXCLUSIVELY: Use PyTorch as the deep learning framework
- HYDRA INTEGRATION: Use Hydra to manage all experiment configurations from `config/runs/*.yaml` files. Use `config_path="../config"` in all @hydra.main decorators
- COMPLETE DATA PIPELINE: Full data loading and preprocessing implementation. Use `.cache/` as the cache directory for all datasets and models (e.g., for HuggingFace, set `cache_dir=".cache/"`)
- WANDB REQUIRED: WandB is mandatory for metrics logging (except trial_mode validation)

## Hydra Configuration Structure
Each run config file (`config/runs/{run_id}.yaml`) contains:
- run_id: Unique identifier for this run
- method: The method name (baseline, proposed, ablation, etc.)
- model: Model-specific parameters (name, architecture details, hyperparameters)
- dataset: Dataset-specific parameters (name, preprocessing settings, split ratios)
- training: Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer settings, validation split)
- optuna: Hyperparameter search space definition for Optuna optimization

## Command Line Interface
The generated code must support the following CLI:

**Training (main.py):**
```bash
# Full experiment with WandB logging
uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=full

# Trial mode (validation only, WandB disabled)
uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=trial
```
- `run`: Experiment run_id (matching a run_id from config/runs/*.yaml)
- `results_dir`: Output directory (passed from GitHub Actions workflow)
- `mode`: Execution mode (required parameter)
  * `mode=trial`: Lightweight execution for validation (epochs=1, batches limited to 1-2, wandb.mode=disabled, optuna.n_trials=0)
  * `mode=full`: Full experiment execution (wandb.mode=online, full epochs, full Optuna trials)
  * **Code must automatically configure based on mode (e.g., `if cfg.mode == "trial": cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"; cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0` elif `cfg.mode == "full": cfg.wandb.mode = "online"`)**

**Evaluation (evaluate.py, independent execution):**
```bash
uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2", ...]'
```
- `results_dir`: Directory containing experiment metadata and where outputs will be saved
- `run_ids`: JSON string list of run IDs to evaluate (e.g., '["run-1-proposed-bert-glue", "run-2-baseline-bert-glue"]')
- Executed as a separate workflow after all training runs complete
- **NOT called from main.py**

## Script Structure (ExperimentCode format)
Generate complete code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:

**`src/train.py`**: Single experiment run executor
- Uses Hydra config to load all parameters
- Called as subprocess by main.py
- Responsibilities:
  * Train model with given configuration
  * Initialize WandB: `wandb.init(entity=cfg.wandb.entity, project=cfg.wandb.project, id=cfg.run.run_id, config=OmegaConf.to_container(cfg, resolve=True), resume="allow")`
  * Skip `wandb.init()` if `cfg.wandb.mode == "disabled"` (trial_mode)
  * **Optuna Integration**: If using Optuna for hyperparameter search, DO NOT log intermediate trial results to WandB - only train once with the best hyperparameters after optimization completes and log that final run
  * **Log ALL metrics to WandB comprehensively**:
    - Use `wandb.log()` at each training step/batch/epoch with ALL relevant metrics
    - Log as frequently as possible (per-batch or per-epoch) to capture training dynamics
    - Use CONSISTENT metric names across train.py and evaluate.py (e.g., if train.py logs "train_acc", evaluate.py MUST use run.history(keys=["train_acc",...]))
  * **Save final/best metrics to WandB summary**:
    - Use `wandb.summary["key"] = value` for final results
  * Print WandB run URL to stdout
- **NO results.json, no stdout JSON output, no figure generation**

**`src/evaluate.py`**: Independent evaluation and visualization script
- **Execution**: Run independently via `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2"]'`
- **NOT called from main.py** - executes as separate workflow after all training completes
- **Responsibilities**:
  * Parse command line arguments:
    - `results_dir`: Output directory path
    - `run_ids`: JSON string list of run IDs (parse with `json.loads(args.run_ids)`)
  * Load WandB config from `config/config.yaml` (in repository root)
  * **Retrieve comprehensive experimental data from WandB API** for specified run_ids:
    ```python
    import json
    api = wandb.Api()
    run_ids = json.loads(args.run_ids)  # Parse JSON string to list
    for run_id in run_ids:
        run = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}")
        history = run.history()  # pandas DataFrame with ALL time-series metrics (train_loss, val_acc, etc.)
        summary = run.summary._json_dict  # Final/best metrics (best_val_acc, final_test_acc, etc.)
        config = dict(run.config)  # Run configuration (hyperparameters, model settings, etc.)
    ```
  * **STEP 1: Per-Run Processing** (for each run_id):
    - Export **comprehensive** run-specific metrics to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/metrics.json`
    - Generate run-specific figures (learning curves, confusion matrices) to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/`
    - Each run should have its own subdirectory with its metrics and figures
  * **STEP 2: Aggregated Analysis** (after processing all runs):
    - Export aggregated metrics to: `{results_dir}/comparison/aggregated_metrics.json` with the following structure:
      ```json
      {
        "primary_metric": "Target-model dev score under 1 MB / 10 %-FLOP budget (report zero-shot and post-tune).",
        "metrics": {
          "metric_name_1": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...},
          "metric_name_2": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...}
        },
        "best_proposed": {
          "run_id": "proposed-iter2-model-dataset",
          "value": 0.92
        },
        "best_baseline": {
          "run_id": "comparative-1-model-dataset",
          "value": 0.88
        },
        "gap": 4.55
      }
      ```
      The structure includes:
      - "primary_metric": The primary evaluation metric name from the hypothesis (Target-model dev score under 1 MB / 10 %-FLOP budget (report zero-shot and post-tune).)
      - "metrics": All collected metrics organized by metric name, then by run_id
      - "best_proposed": The run_id and value of the proposed method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "proposed")
      - "best_baseline": The run_id and value of the baseline/comparative method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "comparative" or "baseline")
      - "gap": Performance gap calculated as: (best_proposed.value - best_baseline.value) / best_baseline.value * 100
        * Use the expected results from the hypothesis (1) Zero-shot: without any extra tuning UniHyperLoRA transfers to BERT-large with <1 % accuracy loss vs source model. 2) After 500 update steps on each task, UniHyperLoRA matches SAT-LoRA that was *retrained* for that architecture while using 97 % less additional memory (0.97 MB vs 33 MB) and identical FLOPs. 3) On TinyBERT the projector correctly shrinks atoms; accuracy +1.1 % over plain LoRA under the same budget.) to determine metric direction
        * If the metric should be minimized (like "loss", "perplexity", "error"), reverse the sign of the gap
        * The gap represents the percentage improvement of the proposed method over the best baseline
    - Generate comparison figures to: `{results_dir}/comparison/`:
      * Cross-run comparison charts (bar charts, box plots)
      * Performance metrics tables
      * Statistical significance tests
  * **Figure Generation Guidelines**:
    - Use matplotlib or seaborn with proper legends, annotations, tight_layout
    - For line graphs: annotate significant values (final/best values)
    - For bar graphs: annotate values above each bar
    - Use GLOBALLY UNIQUE image filenames to prevent collisions across different runs and directories**:
      * Per-run figures: `{run_id}_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `run-1-proposed-bert-glue_learning_curve.pdf`)
      * Comparison figures: `comparison_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `comparison_accuracy_bar_chart.pdf`)
  * Print all generated file paths to stdout (both per-run and comparison)

**`src/preprocess.py`**: Complete preprocessing pipeline implementation for the specified datasets

**`src/model.py`**: Complete model architecture implementations for all methods (proposed and comparative methods)

**`src/main.py`**: Main orchestrator
- Receives run_id via Hydra, launches train.py as subprocess, manages logs
- **DOES NOT call evaluate.py** (evaluate.py runs independently in separate workflow)
- Use `@hydra.main(config_path="../config")` since execution is from repository root
- **Mode handling**: Automatically configure based on `cfg.mode`:
  * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0`, epochs=1, etc.
  * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` and use full configuration

**`config/config.yaml`**: Main Hydra configuration file
- MUST include WandB configuration:
  ```yaml
  wandb:
    entity: gengaru617-personal
    project: 251106-test
    mode: online  # Automatically set to "disabled" in trial_mode
  ```
- `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is automatically available for authentication

**`pyproject.toml`**: Complete project dependencies
- MUST include: `hydra-core`, `wandb` (required)
- Include as needed: `optuna`, `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, etc.


## Key Implementation Focus Areas
1. **Hydra-Driven Configuration**: All parameters loaded from run configs dynamically
2. **Algorithm Core**: Full implementation of the proposed method with proper abstraction
3. **Mode-Based Behavior**: Code must automatically configure based on `cfg.mode` ("trial" vs "full")
   - `mode=trial`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode="disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials=0`, epochs=1, limited batches
   - `mode=full`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode="online"`, use full configuration
4. **Run Execution**: main.py executes a single run_id passed via CLI (GitHub Actions dispatches multiple runs separately)
5. **WandB Integration**: All metrics logged to WandB; train.py does NOT output JSON to stdout or save results.json
6. **Independent Evaluation**: evaluate.py runs separately, fetches data from WandB API, generates all figures

# Hypothesis
open_problems='Existing cross-layer LoRA sharing schemes (SAT-LoRA, HF-SAT-LoRA) still presuppose a *fixed host model*: the functional mixer g_θ is learned **per architecture** and its output dimensionality is hard-wired to the in/out size of every weight matrix.  Hence the learned mixers cannot be reused across (i) different hidden sizes (e.g. BERT-base → DeBERTa-large), (ii) pruned or compressed variants, or (iii) future model versions that add more layers.  Practically this forces practitioners to retrain a new generator for each model, while societally it prevents community-shared, device-ready adapter libraries.  We lack a PEFT mechanism that 1) keeps the global atom dictionary *model-agnostic*, 2) generates layer-specific LoRA updates for *arbitrary* (d_in , d_out) on-the-fly, and 3) still fits into a sub-megabyte memory budget with per-token sparsity.' method='Universal Hyper‐LoRA (UniHyperLoRA)  1.

# Current Research Method
Universal Hyper‐LoRA (UniHyperLoRA)  1. Canonical atom dictionary  U∈ℝ^{M×d₀}, V∈ℝ^{M×d₀} with small anchor dimension d₀=256 (8-bit, M=128). 2. Dimension-aware projectors  For a target weight of shape (d_out , d_in) we compute two thin, *factored* projectors:   P_out(d_out)∈ℝ^{d_out×d₀},  P_in(d_in)∈ℝ^{d₀×d_in}.  They are produced by a shared hyper-MLP h_ψ(size) that takes the log-scaled dimension as input (≈4 kB total). 3. Continuous mixer  g_θ(depth_norm, type_id)→ℝ^M (two-layer sine-activated MLP, 2 k params) outputs real‐valued mixing weights that are quantised to 4-bit at save-time. 4. Token- & task-conditional sparse router r_φ(h_{ℓ,i}, E(task))→Top-k(M) (k≤2) chooses active atoms. 5. Low-rank update  ΔW_{ℓ,i}=∑_{j=1}^k g_top(j)·P_out u_j v_jᵀ P_in.  All matrix multiplications are fused with the base forward pass. 6. Zero-shot portability  When UniHyperLoRA is first trained on a *source* model (e.g. BERT-base), only U,V,θ,ψ,φ are updated.  To adapt a *new* target model with unseen shapes we **freeze** U,V,ψ,φ and fine-tune a 4-bit bias δθ (≈0.5 kB) per task; no architecture-specific retraining. 7. Budget loss  L_task+λ_F·E[k]+λ_Q·‖δθ‖² keeps FLOPs and extra params bounded.

# Experimental Design
- Summary: We first pre-train one universal UniHyperLoRA adapter on a single 12-layer BERT-base model with the SST-2 corpus.  This pre-training jointly learns (1) the canonical atom dictionary U,V, (2) the tiny continuous mixer g_θ, (3) the dimension-hyper-network h_ψ that predicts thin projectors P_in / P_out from log-scaled layer sizes, and (4) the sparse router r_φ that chooses at most k=2 atoms per token.  Only U,V,θ,ψ,φ are updated; the host model’s weights stay frozen.  After three epochs we freeze everything except a 4-bit bias δθ.

For the transfer phase we load the *same* frozen adapter weights into three unseen target architectures (DistilBERT-6L-768, BERT-large-1024, TinyBERT-4L-312).  Because the projector h_ψ is dimension-aware, it instantly produces size-compatible low-rank updates for every (d_out,d_in) pair, so no re-training is needed (zero-shot evaluation).  We then run a short 500-step PEFT fine-tuning on each downstream task (CoNLL-2003 NER, BoolQ, Amazon-Review) updating only δθ.

We compare against a strong baseline—SAT-LoRA—that must be re-learnt per architecture, as well as classical rank-8 LoRA and full fine-tuning, while enforcing the shared resource budget of ≤1 MB extra weights and ≤10 % extra FLOPs.  All experiments are executed on a single NVIDIA A100/H200 with 80 GB VRAM; the unified adapter occupies 0.97 MB in 4-bit form and adds <8 % theoretical FLOPs, satisfying the constraint.

After training we report: (a) dev-set performance of the target model with the adapter inserted but *before* any task-specific updates (zero-shot portability) and (b) the score after 500 δθ optimisation steps.  We also log memory overhead, FLOP overhead, and average active atoms per token.  Results are expected to show that the single UniHyperLoRA file achieves near-lossless zero-shot transfer (≤1 % drop) and, after light tuning, matches or exceeds SAT-LoRA while using ~97 % less additional memory.
- Evaluation metrics: ['Target-model dev score under 1 MB / 10 %-FLOP budget (report zero-shot and post-tune).', 'Memory overhead (MB)', 'FLOP overhead (%)', 'Active atoms per token', 'F1 Score', 'Accuracy']
